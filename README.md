# Minimal Abstract Account on Ethereum

A lightweight and modular implementation of an abstract account on Ethereum, designed for simplicity and flexibility. This project includes contracts and testing for Ethereumâ€™s `Account Abstraction (EIP-4337)` with a focus on modularity, minimalism, and compliance with the latest standards.

## Smart Contracts

- EntryPoint.sol: The central contract implementing the entry point for account abstraction, managing user operations (UserOps) and orchestrating validation and execution.
- MinimalAccount.sol: A simple and extensible abstract account contract for Ethereum, providing basic functionality for account abstraction.
- AccountFactory.sol: Facilitates the deployment of MinimalAccount instances, ensuring streamlined and standardized account creation.
- TestToken.sol: An ERC20 token contract included for testing account interactions and transactions.

## Features

- Account Abstraction: Implements EIP-4337 for modular and gas-efficient account management.
- Minimal Design: Focused on simplicity and extensibility, making it ideal for further customization.
- Modular Architecture: Clean separation of components for ease of understanding and integration into broader systems.
- Factory Deployment: Simplifies the creation of new accounts using the AccountFactory contract.

##Testing

This project includes comprehensive tests to ensure correctness and reliability:

- EntryPoint Functionality: Verified handling of UserOps, validation logic, and execution.
- MinimalAccount Behavior: Tested basic account operations, including authentication and transaction signing.
- Factory Deployments: Confirmed the correct deployment of accounts through the AccountFactory.
- Token Interactions: Ensured smooth integration of MinimalAccount with ERC20 tokens for transactions and approvals.
- Edge Cases and Gas Optimization: Covered various scenarios, including invalid UserOps and gas efficiency under different conditions.
- Extensive Testing Framework: Used Foundry to rigorously test all contracts, ensuring robustness under edge cases.

## How It Works

1. Entry Point: UserOps are sent to the EntryPoint contract for validation and execution.
2. Account Deployment: MinimalAccount instances are deployed via the AccountFactory.
3. User Operations: EntryPoint handles UserOps, delegating execution to MinimalAccount.
4. ERC20 Integration: Interactions with ERC20 tokens are tested for compatibility and efficiency.

## Ideal For

This project is perfect for developers exploring EIP-4337 or looking to build a foundation for account abstraction on Ethereum. Its minimalistic and modular design makes it an excellent starting point for further customization and learning.
